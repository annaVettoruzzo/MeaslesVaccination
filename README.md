Final project for Life Data Epidemiology course.

## Italian opinion on Twitter about measles vaccination

Study the flow of information on measles vaccine in Italy looking at Twitter data in the second half of 2017.
The analysis is characterized by a qualitative study, analyzing geo-localized tweets through sentiment analysis and mapping them in the Italian regions, 
and by a quantitative analysis with a bipartite network (with corresponding projections) of users and hashtags.

NB: figures in the slides related to the network were created using Gephi.

Participants:
